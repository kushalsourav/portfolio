      <h1>How to persist Data?</h1>
      <span class="intro">Introduction</span>
      <p class="description">
        The Web Storage API consists of two mechanisms: sessionStorage and localStorage. Both sessionStorage and localStorage maintain a separate storage area for each available origin for the duration of the page session.
        The main difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that sessionStorage only maintains a storage area while the browser is open while localStorage continues to store data after the browser is closed. In other words, whereas data stored in sessionStorage is cleared when the page is closed, data stored in localStorage does not expire.

      <div class="description">
       <blockquote>localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed.</blockquote>

            <li>  getItem() : This is how you get items from localStorage</li> 
            <li> removeItem() : Remove an item by key from localStorage</li> 
            <li>clear() : Clear all localStorage</li>  
            <li> key() : Passed a number to retrieve the key of a localStorage</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
