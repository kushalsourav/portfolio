        The Taj Mahal  'Crown of the Palace', is an ivory-white marble mausoleum
        on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was
        commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to
        house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the
        tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
        (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set
        in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.The Taj
        Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being
        "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired
        masterpieces of the world's heritage".Construction of the mausoleum was
        essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the
        project for another 10 years.

      <p class="description">
        The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of
        Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came
        from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir
        (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in
        Samarkand),Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and
        hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb
        (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in
        Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red
        sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with
        semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels
        of refinement.The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the
        Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square
        plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an
        arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal
        tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.
