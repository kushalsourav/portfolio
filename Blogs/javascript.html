      <h1>Is javascript compiled or interpreted language?</h1>
      <span class="intro">Introduction</span>
      <p class="description">
     Javascript is interpreted line by line by the browser , it is done by javascript engine. javascript engine is different for diffrene
     browsers. javascript executes libe by line, theres no compilation like in java. but javascript falls under the general category of "dynamic" or "interpreted" languages, but it is a compiled language

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">compilation process</h2>
      <div class="description">
       <blockquote>In Traditional compiled language process invloves three steps in compilation process</blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>Tokennizing</li>
        <li>parsing</li>
        <li>code generation</li>
       </ol>
      </div>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Tokennizing</h2>
      <p class="description">Breaking up a string of characters into meaningfull chunks called as tokens. for example consider a line of code const pi = 3.14;. This can be broken into const , pi , = , 3.14 , ; .</p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Parsing</h2>
      <p class="description">Taking a array of tokens and turning it into a tree of nested elements, which collectively represents "Abstrct Syntax tree"</p>
      <p class="description">
        <ul>
          <li>const is a variable declaration</li>
          <li>pi is a identifer name</li>
          <li>= assignment Expression</li>
          <li>3.12 is a floating point literal</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">code generation</h2>
      <p class="description">The Process of taking an abstract syntax tree and turning it into an executable code is known as code generation.for example it takes const pi = 3.14 and turn it into a set of machine instructions to actually create a constant variable called pi and then store a value into pi.</p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="description">Javascript engine first compiles code before it executes and in doing, it splits up statements</p>
