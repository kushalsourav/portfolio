      <p class="description">
        The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a
        member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark
        vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator,
        it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is
        territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring
        large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for
        prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for
        about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home
        range to establish their own.

      <p class="description">
        The tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and
        a tail that is about half the length of its body. Its pelage is dense
        and heavy, and colouration varies between shades of orange and brown
        with white ventral areas and distinctive vertical black stripes; the
        patterns of which are unique in each individual.Stripes are likely
        advantageous for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with strong
        vertical patterns of light and shade.The tiger is one of only a few
        striped cat species; it is not known why spotted patterns and rosettes
        are the more common camouflage pattern among felids.The orange colour
        may also aid in camouflage as the tiger's prey are dichromats, and thus
        may perceive the cat as green and blended in with the vegetation.
